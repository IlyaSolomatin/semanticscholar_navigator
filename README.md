# semanticscholar_navigator
A piece of code to easily fetch most influential references and citations of a given paper. A paper can be set as S2PaperId, CorpusId, DOI, ArXivId, MAG, ACL, PMID, PMCID, or URL from: semanticscholar.org, arxiv.org, aclweb.org, acm.org, biorxiv.org (as per semanticscholar python module documentation)

Can be further developed into nice citation graph visualizations, as well as into "branch of research" navigator -- a tool that would show how influential works cited each other through time and how big ideas in certain areas of science developed in time.
